<h1>User Personas</h1>
<p>
  The goal of user research is to understand the behaviors, needs and motivations of users. When key audience segments are sought out and documented, this information can be used as a touchstone of reference throughout the entire design process. Defining audiences helps everyone see users as actual people rather than abstractions when choosing design elements and patterns â€“ bringing a sharper focus to product objectives.
