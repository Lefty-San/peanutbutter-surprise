<h1>Heuristic Evaluation</h1>
<p>
  For an interface update (as opposed to a complete redesign), a heuristic evaluation or an expert review is a more cost-effective option than a usability test. A heuristic report identifies usability and other problems and lists specific action items aimed at addressing these issues. This evaluation may be performed by a single UX expert or may be an evaluation by a small group of UX, UI and other experts to target topic areas of improvement.
